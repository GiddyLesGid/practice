## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Python scripts that implement various data structures and algorithms. The purpose is to provide a resource for learning, practicing, and mastering these essential programming concepts. Each implementation is designed to be as clear and concise as possible, with comments and explanations to aid understanding.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/py_practice.git](https://github.com/GiddyLesGid/py_practice.git

```

# Running the Scripts
Each script can be run individually. Navigate to the directory where you've cloned the repository and run a script using Python. For example:

```
cd py_practice
python path/to/script.py

```

# Data Structures

  - Arrays: Implementation and operations on arrays.
  -  Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists.
  -  tacks: Stack implementation and operations.
  -  Queues: Queue implementation and operations.
  -  Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal methods.
  -  Graphs: Graph representation and traversal algorithms.
  -  Hash Tables: Hash table implementation and operations.

# Algorithms
